name: review-pr-comments-together
description: Walk through pull request review comments one at a time with the user before making or resolving changes. Uses one orchestrator agent that spawns a fresh subagent per comment with isolated context. Presents click-to-choose polls (AskQuestion) at every decision point so the user picks an approach instead of typing. Two phases per session — triage first (analyze, decide, implement locally), then GitHub (react, reply, resolve). Caches PR comments in .cursor/local/review-pr-cache.jsonl and tracks decisions in .cursor/local/review-pr-progress.md (gitignored, never committed). Resumes at the first not-yet-implemented comment. Use when the user wants to understand PR feedback, triage comments collaboratively, resolve review threads together, or says "go over comments one by one", "walk me through the PR review", or "let's resolve comments together".

# Review PR Comments Together

## Roles at a glance

| Agent | Job | Never |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Orchestrator** | Spawn subagents · **run AskQuestion polls** · record decisions · maintain checklist + `progress.md` · read one cache line per spawn | Read code · analyze comments · draft text · implement fixes · call `gh` · load full cache or full progress table |
| **Index** | Fetch PR via `gh` · write cache · return slim index | Analyze · post to GitHub |
| **Comment** | Analyze one comment + nearby code | See other comments · fix code · post to GitHub |
| **Reply** | Draft reply text for one comment | Post to GitHub · fix code |
| **Fix** | Patch + tests + suggested reply for one comment | See other comments · post to GitHub |
| **GitHub** | `gh api` react/reply/resolve for one comment (phase 2 only) | Analyze · change code |

**Subagent-first:** if a task can run in an isolated subagent, the orchestrator must spawn one. Spawn with the **Task** tool. Never resume a subagent for the next step.

---

## Two-phase session

| Phase | Goal | GitHub (`gh`) |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **1 — Triage** | Analyze every comment · record decisions · implement fixes · draft replies | **Never** — plan actions only (`~` prefix in progress) |
| **2 — GitHub** | Post planned reactions, replies, resolves | **Yes** — one GitHub subagent per comment |

**Phase 1 ends** when every row has `i ≠ .` (header `next = M+1`).  
**Phase 2 starts** when the user picks **Post to GitHub** in the triage-complete poll (or types an equivalent confirm).

After each triage decision the orchestrator says **one line**: `"Planned for GitHub phase: …"` — no `gh` calls.

---

## Poll-first UX (orchestrator)

**Always use the AskQuestion tool** when the user must choose — never end a turn with "what would you like to do?" free text. AskQuestion always includes **Other** for custom input; reserve that for edge cases.

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **One poll per turn** | Post comment analysis (or fix/reply result), then one AskQuestion. Do not bundle unrelated questions. |
| **Recommended first** | Put the comment subagent's suggested resolution as option 1 with `(Recommended)` in the label. |
| **Short labels** | ≤60 chars; put detail in the analysis above the poll, not in option text. |
| **Map ids → progress** | Use the tables below; never invent new `d` codes. |
| **Free text fallback** | If the user replies in chat instead of clicking, treat it like **Other** and continue. |

### Poll A — Session start (cache hit only)

When cache exists and user did not say "refresh":

| id | Label |
|----|-------|
| `resume` | Resume where we left off (Recommended) |
| `refresh` | Refresh comments from GitHub |
| `restart` | Restart triage from comment 1 |

### Poll B — Triage decision (after every comment subagent)

Build options from the comment subagent's **Poll options** block (2–5 items). Always include applicable standard ids; omit ids that don't fit.

| id | Label pattern | `d` | `i` | Next subagent |
|----|---------------|-----|-----|---------------|
| `fix` | Fix: {short summary} | `f` | `.` → `x` after fix | Fix |
| `agree` | Agree — no change needed | `a` | `n` | — |
| `praise` | Praise — thanks, no change | `a` | `n` | — |
| `reply` | Reply only — no code change | `r` | `n` | Reply |
| `disagree` | Disagree — reply explaining why | `d` | `n` | Reply |
| `defer` | Defer — handle in a follow-up | `~` | `n` | Reply |
| `done` | Already fixed / addressed | `a` | `n` | — |

**AskQuestion example** (orchestrator fills `options` from Poll options; first = recommended):

```
title: "Comment {index} of {total}"
prompt: "How should we handle @{u}'s feedback on {basename}:{l}?"
questions: [{ id: "action", options: [ …from comment subagent poll block… ] }]
```

### Poll C — After fix subagent

| id | Label | Effect |
|----|-------|--------|
| `approve` | Approve fix — continue (Recommended) | Patch `i:x`, planned `gh`; optional Poll D |
| `revise` | Revise — try a different approach | Re-spawn Fix with `User notes: revise — {Other text}` |
| `undo` | Skip fix — pick a different triage action | Reset row `i:. d:—`, re-run Poll B |

### Poll D — Resolve thread? (after `approve` on Poll C, or when fix + resolve is ambiguous)

Only when planned actions include a reply and resolve is not obvious.

| id | Label | `gh` addition |
|----|-------|---------------|
| `resolve_yes` | Yes — resolve thread after reply (Recommended for shipped fixes) | add `~x` |
| `resolve_no` | No — leave thread open | no `~x` |

Skip Poll D when praise/agree (no reply) or user already chose defer.

### Poll E — After reply subagent

| id | Label | Effect |
|----|-------|--------|
| `approve` | Approve reply — continue (Recommended) | Store draft in `n`, patch row, advance |
| `revise` | Revise — regenerate reply | Re-spawn Reply with `User notes: revise — {Other}` |
| `resolve_yes` | Approve and resolve thread | add `~x` to `gh` |
| `resolve_no` | Approve but leave thread open | no `~x` |

Combine `approve` + resolve into one poll when possible (`allow_multiple: true` on resolve only if the UI supports it cleanly; otherwise use Poll D).

### Poll F — Triage complete

| id | Label | Effect |
|----|-------|--------|
| `github` | Post everything to GitHub now (Recommended) | `phase:github`, start at `gh_next` |
| `summary` | Show triage summary first | Print checklist; re-poll with `github` / `stop` |
| `stop` | Stop here — I'll post to GitHub later | End session; progress saved |

### Poll G — GitHub phase (per comment, before spawning GitHub subagent)

| id | Label | Effect |
|----|-------|--------|
| `post` | Post as planned (Recommended) | Spawn GitHub subagent |
| `skip` | Skip this comment on GitHub | Patch `s:x`, clear pending `~` actions, advance |
| `edit` | Change plan before posting | Re-poll triage action (Poll B) for this row only |

Default: **auto-`post`** when user said "post all" / picked `github` on Poll F — only pause with Poll G if the row has `~r` and `n` is empty.

### Poll H — Session finish

| id | Label |
|----|-------|
| `push` | Push branch to remote |
| `summary` | Generate reviewer summary (markdown) |
| `done` | Done — nothing else (Recommended) |

---

## Session files — never commit

Both live under `.cursor/local/` (gitignored). Never stage or commit them.

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `review-pr-cache.jsonl` | Immutable comment data written by index subagent |
| `review-pr-progress.md` | Orchestrator decisions and session state |

**Orchestrator read rule:** use Read with `offset = index + 1`, `limit = 1` on the cache. Never load the full file or multiple lines at once.

### Cache — `review-pr-cache.jsonl`

Line 1 (header):
```json
{"v":1,"pr":2,"title":"…","url":"https://github.com/…/pull/2","state":"OPEN","head":"abc123","fetched":"2026-06-15T12:00:00Z","m":15}
```

Lines 2…M+1 (one comment each):
```json
{"i":1,"id":3413223024,"p":"internal/provider/foo.go","l":28,"u":"ozviran-matia","b":"**praise:** 💪","pid":null,"pb":null}
```

| Key | Field |
|-----|-------|
| `i` | index (1-based) |
| `id` | GitHub comment databaseId |
| `p` | file path |
| `l` | line |
| `u` | reviewer login |
| `b` | comment body (verbatim) |
| `pid` | `in_reply_to_id` or null |
| `pb` | parent body or null |

**Cache hit** (skip index subagent): header exists, `pr` matches, user did not say "refresh".  
**Cache miss** → spawn index subagent.

### Progress — `review-pr-progress.md`

Do **not** duplicate cache fields here (no IDs, links, bodies, full paths).

```markdown
<!-- LOCAL — DO NOT COMMIT -->
# PR #{number} | done:{D}/{M} | next:{N}
phase:{triage|github}
gh_next:{G}
lu:{ISO date}
cache: review-pr-cache.jsonl

| # | s | i | u | loc | d | gh | n |
|---|--:|--:|---|-----|---|----|---|
| 1 | . | . | alice | foo.go:28 | — | — | — |
```

**Header** (lines 1–6) is all the orchestrator reads on resume — never load the full table into context.

#### Column codes

| Col | Value | Meaning |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `i` | `.` | not implemented yet — resume starts here |
| `i` | `x` | fix applied (or user confirmed done) |
| `i` | `n` | no code change needed (praise / reply-only / defer) |
| `s` | `.` | GitHub not done yet |
| `s` | `x` | GitHub done |
| `d` | `—` `a` `f` `d` `r` `~` | no decision · agree · fix · disagree · reply-only · defer |
| `gh` | `—` | nothing planned or posted |
| `gh` | `~+1` `~♥` `~🚀` `~👀` | planned reaction (phase 1) |
| `gh` | `~r` | planned reply — draft stored in `n` |
| `gh` | `~x` | planned resolve (only if user confirmed) |
| `gh` | `+1` `♥` `🚀` `👀` `r` `x` | posted (phase 2) — combine: `🚀,r,x` |
| `loc` | `basename:line` | final path segment + line only |
| `n` | short text | user note / reply draft ≤80 chars |

#### Default planned GitHub actions (phase 1)

| Decision | `i` | planned `gh` |
|----------|-----|--------------|
| Agree / no-action / praise | `n` | `~+1` (praise → `~♥`) |
| Fix shipped | `x` | `~🚀,~r` |
| Disagree / reply-only / defer | `n` | `~r` (draft in `n`) |
| Resolve? | — | add `~x` only if user explicitly confirms |

#### Progress update rules

| When | Read | Write |
|------|------|-------|
| Session start / resume | Header lines 1–6 | — |
| After index subagent | — | Full file (compact table) |
| User decides (phase 1) | — | Patch one row + header `lu`, `next` |
| Fix subagent done | — | Patch one row `i:x`, planned `gh` + header `next`, `lu` |
| Triage complete | — | Header `phase:github`, `gh_next` |
| GitHub subagent done | — | Patch one row + header `done`, `gh_next`, `lu` |

**Init (fresh PR):** all rows `s:. i:. d:— gh:— n:—`, header `done:0/{M} | next:1 | phase:triage | gh_next:1`.  
**Refresh (same PR):** merge — preserve `i`, `d`, `gh`, `n`, `s` for existing rows; add new; drop removed. Never reset `i:x` or `i:n` to `.`.

## Orchestrator workflow

### 0 — Cache check

1. Read line 1 of `.cursor/local/review-pr-cache.jsonl` (if exists).
2. Read header lines 1–6 of `.cursor/local/review-pr-progress.md` (if exists).
3. **Cache hit:** `pr` matches + no refresh request → run **Poll A** unless user already said resume/refresh. If `phase:github` → resume phase 2 at `gh_next`. Else resume phase 1 at `next` (first `i:.`).
4. **Cache miss** → spawn index subagent.

### 1 — Index subagent

See [`agents/index.md`](agents/index.md) for the full spawn prompt.

After it returns: tell the user `PR #N has M comments. Starting comment {next}.` Initialize or merge `progress.md`. Spawn comment subagent at `next`.

### 2 — Comment subagent

Read cache line `{index + 1}` (limit 1). Build `html_url` as `{cache.url}#discussion_r{id}`.

See [`agents/comment.md`](agents/comment.md) for the full spawn prompt.

Orchestrator posts the subagent's output verbatim (must include the **Link** line), then immediately runs **Poll B** (AskQuestion). Do not ask the user to type their choice.

### 3 — User decides (phase 1)

Map the poll answer to `d` / `i` / planned `gh` (see **Poll-first UX** tables). Patch progress (one row + header), state planned GitHub action in one line, then:

| Poll B id | Next step |
|-----------|-----------|
| `agree` / `praise` / `done` | Next comment (spawn Comment subagent) |
| `fix` | Fix subagent → **Poll C** on return |
| `reply` / `disagree` / `defer` | Reply subagent (`Decision:` = id) → **Poll E** on return |

See [`agents/fix.md`](agents/fix.md) and [`agents/reply.md`](agents/reply.md).

After Poll C `approve` (and Poll D if needed) or Poll E `approve`: patch row, state planned action, spawn next Comment subagent.

### 4 — Triage complete → GitHub phase

When `next = M+1`: announce triage complete, run **Poll F**.

On `github`: set `phase:github`, set `gh_next` to first `s:.` row. For each comment run **Poll G** (or auto-`post`), then spawn GitHub subagent until `gh_next = M+1`.

See [`agents/github.md`](agents/github.md) for the GitHub subagent spawn prompt.

After each GitHub subagent: patch row (`s:x`, replace `~` codes with posted codes), bump `done`, advance `gh_next`.

### 5 — Finish

Summarize from header `done:{D}/{M}` and in-chat checklist. Run **Poll H**. Never commit session files.

## Checklist (orchestrator, in-chat)

One line per comment — updated after each decision:
```
- [x] Comment 1 — 👍 reacted
- [x] Comment 2 — fixed, replied, resolved
- [ ] Comment 3 — replied (deferred)
```
